    you can make the price of Bitcoin whatever you want - until too many people 
    try and cash out, that is.

- quote: | Binance, the #1 Tether exchange, is racing to get U.S. users off 
    its exchange. We saw something similar with BitMex 
    before its operators were indicted.

- quote: | We have not entered "Post Tether" yet. 
    Tether is still furiously printing digital bucks. 
    Who believes Bitcoin's price is organic? 
    It's not - it's a Ponzi, and Tether is its Little Helper.

- quote: | Ponzi's collapse when they can't keep up with cash withdrawals. 
    All frauds snowball over time because the real money keeps getting 
    sucked out of the system.

- quote: | If you need more help understanding how fake digital dollars hurt retail investors, 
    look at what happened to Mt. Gox and QuadrigaCX. 
    Eventually, the Ponzi collapses, because there is not enough real money in the system.
