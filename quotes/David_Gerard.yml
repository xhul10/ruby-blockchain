- quote: | Tether is "too big to fail" - the entire crypto industry utterly 
    depends on it. We just topped twenty billion alleged dollars' worth of tethers ($USDT). 
    If you think this is sustainable, you're a fool.

- quote: | Bitcoin mining.  Bitcoin's BIG PROBLEM is that it uses a country's worth of electricity 
    to run the most inefficient payment network in human history.

    People don't seem to know this! and I tell them, and they get angry. 
    Because a bunch of nerds killing each other for e-pennies is one thing, 
    but that much CO2 is quite another.

    You could say "It's their money, they can spend it how they like", 
    and that's how things work, sure. But it's still a massive externality, and this is a big problem.

- quote: |  Bitcoin is not technology, it's ideology
    and the psychology of get rich for free. People will believe ANY NONSENSE 
    if they might get rich for free.

    The technology is a  MacGuffin , it's an excuse for quick flimflam.
