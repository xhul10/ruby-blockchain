    Imagine not buying Bitcoin at $22 - $30 because you think you missed the bus at $10 ... 
    I am here to tell you it's the same now with $22 000 - $30 000. 
    Buying at $10 000 versus $22 000 won't matter in the long run.

    Bitcoin Classic (BTC) is ridiculous; in what world is paying $15 to move a mere $90 ok? 
    This is literally worst than PayPal, Western Union and my bank COMBINED 
    (it costs the same if I were to send with all three TOGETHER). 
    I clearly see the use-case for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) now.
