    A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors.
    Ponzi schemes are named after Charles Ponzi. In the 1920s, Ponzi promised investors a 50% return 
    within a few months for what he claimed was an investment in international mail coupons.

    Ponzi Schemes. With little or no legitimate earnings, 
    Ponzi schemes require a constant flow of new money to survive. 
    When it becomes hard to recruit new investors, 
    or when large numbers of existing investors cash out, 
    these schemes collapse.

    Ponzi scheme "red flags" - High returns with little or no risk:
    Every investment carries some degree of risk, 
    and investments yielding higher returns typically involve more risk. 
    Be highly suspicious of any "guaranteed" [number-go-up to-the-moon] "investment" opportunity.

    Ponzi scheme "red flags" - Avoid too-good-to-be-true "investments" with claims like:
    - "To the moon! To the mars!" 
    - "Number go up!"
    - "Yearly return of 300+% in 2020!"
    - "Could quadruple in 2021 and rally to $100,000!"
