    A friend of mine, who works in finance, asked me to explain what Tether was.

    Short version: Tether is the internal accounting system for
    the largest fraud since Madoff's ponzi scheme.

    Many Bitcoin exchanges use "I am a James Bond villain" as a compliance strategy;
    they are present everywhere and nowhere geographically,
    always where they need to be to move the plot along
    but never where they are meaningfully constrained.

    Much like Bond villains, though,
    most Bitcoin exchanges will not survive the third act.
