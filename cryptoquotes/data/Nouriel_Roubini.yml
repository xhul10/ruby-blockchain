    Almost no merchant uses Bitcoin as its price volatility
    leads to market risk that any profit margin is wiped out before you can convert
    it back into USD. Not scalable means of payments.
    It's toxic for the environment as proof-of-waste
    hogs enormous amounts of energy and pollutes the earth.

    Gold/silver don't provide income but give capital gains,
    utility (jewelry) and used in industry.  Bitcoin doesn't give income,
    has no other utility services (such as unit of account or means of payments)
    and provides only capital gains (or losses) based purely on speculative motives.

    Bitcoin has NO intrinsic fundamental value,
    use or utility or any other service. It is a pure speculative manipulated "asset"
    and bubble with no fundamental value. It is not even an hedge against risk off episodes:
    every time stocks go down, bitcoin falls much more.

    Investing in Bitcoin is equivalent to take your portfolio
    to a rigged illegal casino and gamble; at least in legit Las Vegas casinos odds
    aren't stacked against you as those gambling markets aren't manipulated
    the way Bitcoin is. Instead Bitcoin is manipulated heavily by Tether and whales.

    Pump & dump, spoofing, wash trading,
    front-running are standard operating procedures in crypto exchanges where Bitcoin is traded.
    Liquidity of these exchanges is fake as volume data are false by a 90% degree.
    Unbacked Tether supply perfectly tracks this year like in the past the Bitcoin price.

    Which "store of value" drops in risk off episodes like Bitcoin did in March
    by more than 60%? It is a highly manipulated and highly volatile
    pseudo-"asset" that is no hedge against risk-of episodes.
    And has ZERO intrinsic value...

    2% of accounts control 95% of bitcoin assets.
    Inequality Gini coefficient of Bitcoin is worse than the one
    of North Korea where Mr Kim and his cronies controls most of the country assets!

    No use ever, past, present and future for XRP and Ripple products...
    it is already flopping after spending a fortune and printing a huge amount
    of totally useless XRP. (Now the XRP army of Twitter trolls,
    bots, hired guns and zealots will attack again...)

    From Coin Geek: «iFinex Corp. (parent company to Bitfinex, Tether and all their subs)
    colluded with their partners to conjure up limitless liquidity out of thin air.
    While Bitcoin advocates criticize the money-printers of the Fed
    they insulate Tether (USDT) from criticism and defend it.»

    From Bitfinex'ed:
    «Stablecoins "backed" by USD are technically already illegal.
    Because if they were to gain traction, people would be able to have numbered,
    and anonymous, bank accounts.

    You've reinvented numbered bank accounts.»
