    The Bitcoin "Nakamoto Scheme" is an automated hybrid of a Ponzi and pyramid scheme 
    which has, from the perspective of operating a criminal enterprise, 
    the strengths of both and the weaknesses of neither.

    The Nakamoto Scheme draws strength from what make pyramids and Ponzis 
    so compelling:
    a) it promises insane investment returns, 
    b) can be accessed by the man on the street with almost no effort at all, and  
    c) recruits individual participants as new, self-interested evangelists of the scheme.

    The Bitcoin "Nakamoto Scheme" have no central operator. 
    This ensures that no single member or entity can be held liable 
    (as with a Ponzi or pyramid) and obscures the identity of participants from law enforcement.

    This also, like a pyramid scheme, has the insidious quality of turning 
    every victim of the scheme into a new principal as they talk up their books 
    for the purpose of recruiting new investors to subsidize their exits.

    > - Largest electronic payment processor in the world
    > - $8.9 trillion in 141 billion transactions per year
    > - Across 160 currencies and over 200 countries
   
    For contrast, Bitcoin gets about 3 transactions per second, 
    with one "currency," and the network is currently clogged.

    Considering the alternative (using old school finance and landing in jail), 
    I can see how some Bitcoiners might see this as a price worth paying 
    in order to access the billions of dollars currently sloshing around in the Bitcoin markets.
