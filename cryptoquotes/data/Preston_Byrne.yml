    The Bitcoin "Nakamoto Scheme" is an automated hybrid of a Ponzi and pyramid scheme 
    which has, from the perspective of operating a criminal enterprise, 
    the strengths of both and the weaknesses of neither.

    The Nakamoto Scheme draws strength from what make pyramids and Ponzis 
    so compelling:
    a) it promises insane investment returns, 
    b) can be accessed by the man on the street with almost no effort at all, and  
    c) recruits individual participants as new, self-interested evangelists of the scheme.

- quote: |
    The Bitcoin "Nakamoto Scheme" has no central operator. 
    This ensures that no single member or entity can be held liable 
    (as with a Ponzi or pyramid) and obscures the identity of participants from law enforcement.

    This also, like a pyramid scheme, has the insidious quality of turning 
    every victim of the scheme into a new principal as they talk up their books 
    for the purpose of recruiting new investors to subsidize their exits.

    > - Across 160 currencies and over 200 countries
   
    For contrast, Bitcoin gets about 3 transactions per second, 
    with one "currency," and the network is currently clogged.

    Considering the alternative (using old school finance and landing in jail), 
    I can see how some Bitcoiners might see this as a price worth paying 
    in order to access the billions of dollars currently sloshing around in the Bitcoin markets.

    An investment scheme backed by introducing new investors...
 
    ...and not backed by income-generating assets can be called a number of things. 
    I leave it to you to decide what name you will choose.

    A stablecoin that is collateralized by itself is a complex and fragile 
    "Nakamoto Scheme" - an automated hybrid of a Ponzi and pyramid scheme - 
    doomed to fail.

    A stablecoin that is collateralized by real assets and structured correctly 
    is not a stablecoin, but a unit trust.
