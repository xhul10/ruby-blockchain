    Given the challenge of how to invest $600 million in treasury reserves, 
    after a lifetime of experience and months of analysis, 
    I decided on an allocation of 100% Bitcoin, 
    0% Bonds, 0% Stocks, 0% Real Estate, 0% Gold.  
    Seems rational to me. Number go up! To the moon!

    Money is energy. Bitcoin is the first crypto monetary energy network, 
    capable of collecting all the world's liquid energy, 
    storing it over time without power loss, 
    and channeling it across space with negligible impedance. Number go up! To the moon!

    Banks once offered savings accounts yielding 5% annual interest, taxable.  
    Today, banks offer 0% interest, or you can choose the Bank of Bitcoin, 
    offering a savings account currently yielding more than 100% annual interest, 
    tax deferred. Number go up! To the moon!
