    REMINDER: Bitcoiners don't want to sell their Bitcoin and now institutions want exposure measured 
    in the billions of dollars to the asset.
    
    The only way to accommodate everyone is for the US dollar price of Bitcoin to appreciate rapidly.
    To the moon! Number go up!

    I always say it is nearly impossible for an investor to have twenty good ideas. 

    They have one to five, but lack the conviction and confidence to build heavily concentrated positions.

    My single best idea for last few years was Bitcoin. 

    It is beautiful to see a thesis materialize.

    Bitcoin is the single most important piece of technology that has been created in the last few decades.
    
    It is saving lives, increasing freedom, and giving millions of people hope around the world.

    There are an increasing number of buyers, yet a decreasing amount of available Bitcoin. 

    Any economics 101 student can predict what happens next.

    Bitcoin in circulation: $0.5 trillion.
    Fed Reserve notes in circulation: $2.02 trillion. 

    This will flip by the end of 2021. We are watching disruption in real time.
    To the moon! Number go up!

    The market has rendered a decisive victory for Bitcoiners.
    
    When investors needed a safe haven asset, they ran to the hardest money that's ever been created.
