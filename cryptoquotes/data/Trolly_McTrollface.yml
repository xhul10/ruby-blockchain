#  I said Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme before it was cool. 
#  Buying magical virtual coins from mysterious people on the Internet will not make you rich.

- quote: | People will believe anything, as long as it gives them an easy answer 
    to the most important question in the universe: "How can I become rich quickly and without working?"
    "International reply coupon exchange" sounded just as cool and mysterious as "censorship-resistant money".

- quote: | The crypto cartel's smartest propaganda move was to create the HODLer culture. 
    By glorifying the act of doing nothing, they reached out to the self-entitled, lazy millionaire wannabes.
    Every Ponzi scheme relies on the hope that investors won't sell.
    This one's just too obvious.

- quote: | Crypto split: the act of telling regulators that your token "isn't a security or
    a currency, it's no more than a database entry, really - people who buy it
    must be morons!", while simultaneously telling your investors 
    that they're somehow buying a stake in the Next Big Thing.

- quote: | Bitcoin maximalists make me laugh with their pitiful P&Ls.
    I found a weird stone the other day,
    and we've been buying it from each other with a friend, ever since.
    I'm up $57 000 last week alone.
    Some idiots told me I couldn't sell my investment, well, WHY WOULD I? It's going up!
