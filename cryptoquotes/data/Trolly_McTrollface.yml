#  I said Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme before it was cool.
#  Buying magical virtual coins from mysterious people on the Internet will not make you rich.

    Congrats on writing about Bitcoin's price without mentioning Tether ($USDT).
    It's like writing about bond yields without mentioning inflation and the Fed.

    People will believe anything, as long as it gives them an easy answer
    to the most important question in the universe: "How can I become rich quickly and without working?"
    "International reply coupon exchange" sounded just as cool and mysterious as "censorship-resistant money".

- quote: |
    The crypto cartel's smartest propaganda move was to create the HODLer culture.
    By glorifying the act of doing nothing, they reached out to the self-entitled,
    lazy millionaire wannabes.
    Every Ponzi scheme relies on the hope that investors won't sell.
    This one's just too obvious.

    Crypto split: the act of telling regulators that your token "isn't a security
    or a currency, it's no more than a database entry, really - people who buy it
    must be morons!", while simultaneously telling your investors
    that they're somehow buying a stake in the Next Big Thing.

    Bitcoin maximalists make me laugh with their pitiful P&Ls.
    I found a weird stone the other day,
    and we've been buying it from each other with a friend, ever since.
    I'm up $57 000 last week alone.
    Some idiots told me I couldn't sell my investment, well, WHY WOULD I? It's going up!

    Since Tether started the exponential printing of its USDT coin eight months ago, 
    USDT has lost 80% of its value.
    The trick was to make people believe that 1 USDT = 1 USD. 
    Which, because nobody can sell their USDTs, wasn't that hard.
    Crypto is the Hotel California of financial assets.

    So far this year,
    US monetary base is up 42%.
    The amount of $USDTs outstanding is up 311%.
    
    The Fed stopped when they got asset prices back to where they were pre-COVID, 
    because that's its job: stability.
    Tether didn't stop, because that's its job: pump until fear of missing out (FOMO) then cash out.
