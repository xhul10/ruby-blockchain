    There are 3.5 billion smart phones on the planet. 
    All of them can hold bitcoin. None of them can hold gold. 
    Bitcoin is the future. Number go up! To the moon!

    > To be precise, none of the smart phones hold any bitcoin. Bitcoin is on the blockchain. 
    > What you hold in a smart phone is only the private key to sign transactions for your bitcoin on the blockchain.

    Bitcoin will overtake gold. I can't say when, 
    but I can say within the next decade. 

    Bitcoin grew 60x in the past five years. 
    To overtake gold it will need to grow 25x in the next ten years - 
    in other words, grow half as much in twice as much time.

    Number go up! To the moon!

    Over the years many many people have told me that their financial advisor 
    "advised" them to NOT buy bitcoin. $24 000 is a reminder that you should 
    believe in yourself, build your own conviction, and don't let 
    the "experts" distract you from your genius.
